# CodeRefactor
Refactoring a site for semantic HTML and better accessibility

## Description

- Site was not properly coded with semantic HTML elements and needed updated.
- Images had no alt attributes for screen readers to utilize.
- Needed to make sure code was in a logical order and headings sequential for ease of use.
- Original code needed comments to make it easier to understand how page was structured and styled.
- Refactored CSS and HTML to consolidate classes to simplify code and styling.
